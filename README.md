# Minimalist Kanban Board

This project is a minimalist Kanban board built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Material UI**, and **Framer Motion**. It allows you to manage tasks across four columns: Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, and Done. Tasks are draggable between columns and persist across reloads.
